1.Find whether there is a subset of arr such that its sum equals given sum.
i/p -> arr[ ] and sum
o/p->bool

2.Find whether we can divide the given arr in 2 eql parts
i/p-> arr[ ]
o/p -> bool

3.Count the no. of subsets with given sum.
i/p -> arr[ ] and sum
o/p->int

4.Find min diff between subsets of arr
i/p -> arr[ ]
o/p->int

5.Count the no. of pairs of subsets with given diff
i/p -> arr[ ] and diff
o/p->int

6.No. of ways we can assign + or - such that sum==given sum
