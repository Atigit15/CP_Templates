// In MCM an array or a string is given 

1. MCM - Put brackets to min cost
2.Palindrome Partitioning
3. Evaluate exprsn to true/ Boolean Parenthesis
4. Scrambled String
5. Egg Dropping problem

Two matrices A (a x b) and B (b x c) cost of multiplication = axbxc.
1.Given an array of n elements representing dimensions of n-1 matrices find  a way to put brackets such that cost is minimised retrun the cost.
i/p->	10 30  5 60
o/p->	4500 ([AXB]XC)

2.Given a string find the min no. of partitions that will make each part of s a palindrome
i/p->	nitik
o/p->	2

3.Given a string having T,F,|,& and /or ^. find the no. of ways we can put brackets such that it evaluates to true.
i/p->	T^F&T
o/p->	2 

4.Given 2 strings find whether they are scrambled string of each other
i/p ->	great
	rgeat
o/p-> 	true (bool)

5. Given no. of floors and eggs, find the min no of attempts it would take to find the critikal floor(topmost floor from which egg doesnt break) in the worst case.
i/p->	e=3	f=5
o/p-> 	3
