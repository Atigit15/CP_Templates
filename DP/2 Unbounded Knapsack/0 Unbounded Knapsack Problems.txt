1.Rod Cutting Problem
2.Coin Change I - total no. of ways
3.Coin Change II - min no. of coins

1. Given length of rod and prices for certain length we have to cut the rod in such a way such that profit is maximised.
i/p -> length[] prices[] and N (length of rod)
o/p->int (max Profit)

2.Given denominations of coins and a sum, find the total no. of ways that sum can be formed.
i/p->coins[] and sum
o/p->int

3.Given denominations of coins and a sum, find th emin no. of coins needed to make that sum.
i/p->coins[] and sum
o/p->int
